Requires PHP: 7.0
Tested up to: 6.8
Stable tag: 8.10.34

Adds a Honeypot and a clean image captcha to Contact Form 7 and Login/Registration forms. Images are made using Font Awesome's font icons.

== Description ==

Adds a honeypot and an image captcha to your contact form 7 forms by adding the shortcode [cf7ic] to the form editor where you want the captcha to appear. You can also add the image CAPTCHA to the login and registration form by enabling the feature in the Login Page Options. This plugin uses the Font Awesome font icon library to generate the images used in the captcha. Requires PHP 7+.

You can now add custom SVGs!
Simply install the plugin Safe SVG By Daryll Doyle, upload your SVGs to your Media Library, Enable SVGs through the plugin options and add your custom SVG icons through the Choose Default Icons option.

Along with this new option, you can also use a shortcode `[ai1ic-svg id="example"]` to pull in those SVG's into your theme. For Example, if you uploaded an SVG called blue-bird.svg and you wanted to use that SVG on your site, you would add this shortcode `[ai1ic-svg id="blue-bird"]`. Make sure you do not include `.svg` or the icon will not appear.

Some of the shortcode options are:
id: The SVG file name without `.svg`.
output: There are three options, `inline` will output the SVG code directly into the site which helps improve site performance by reduce network requests, `image` will place your SVG in an image tag, and `url` will output the svg src link if you prefer to add it to  your own image tag.
alt: Add your own image alt tag description, Example alt="Blue Bird".
